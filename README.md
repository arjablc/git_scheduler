# Git Pusher

An automated git pushing script, made for personal obsidian vault.

- [x] Basic pushing script.
- [ ] Adding params for directory, commit message and remote branch name.
- [ ] Making it run on change to some files (looking for some other trigger)
    This might need the script to be enabled in the background.


Lame script but I want to make it anyways.
